 = FUSE4Java - Filesystem in Userspace for Java =
 
 FUSE4Java is a recent fork of the stalled Fuse4J project by Peter Lavart.
 It provides a bit more unified filesystem interface and separated better between
 the examples, the core library and native elements. The goal is to make it 
 much easier for third party to rely on Fuse4Java for own projects.
